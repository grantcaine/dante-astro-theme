**Note:** Just a reminder that we run by appointments.  So please always ring ahead.  Our staff are wonderful at triaging and if there is an emergency we will always try our best to rearrange and fit you in. Sometimes our vet may be out of the clinic on a farm call.  Ringing ahead  also allows for you to find an alternative in an emergency if there is no vet on site.
